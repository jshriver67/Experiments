Duplicate Image Finder - Program Specification
Overview
A command-line utility that scans a local drive or specified directories to identify duplicate images based on visual content similarity, not just filename matching.
Core Requirements
1. Input Parameters

Target directories: Accept one or more directory paths to scan
Recursive scanning: Option to include subdirectories (default: enabled)
File format filtering: Support common image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, WebP)
Size thresholds: Minimum/maximum file size filters to exclude thumbnails or extremely large files
Similarity threshold: Configurable percentage for determining duplicates (default: 95%)

2. Duplicate Detection Methods

Perceptual hashing: Primary method using pHash or similar algorithm to detect visually similar images
Exact hash matching: MD5/SHA-256 for identical files with different names
Metadata comparison: EXIF data analysis for images with identical capture details
Dimension matching: Resolution-based comparison as secondary validation

3. Performance Optimization

Caching: Store computed hashes in a local database to avoid reprocessing
Multi-threading: Parallel processing for large directory scans
Progress reporting: Real-time progress indicators with ETA
Memory management: Efficient handling of large image collections without excessive RAM usage

4. Output Options

Report formats: Console output, CSV, JSON, or HTML report
Grouping: Organize results by duplicate sets with file paths, sizes, and modification dates
Preview generation: Optional thumbnail creation for visual verification
Statistics: Summary of space savings potential and duplicate counts

5. User Interface

Dry run mode: Preview results without taking action
Interactive mode: Allow user to select which duplicates to keep/delete
Batch operations: Automated deletion based on rules (keep newest, largest, or shortest path)
Confirmation prompts: Safety checks before permanent deletions

Success Criteria

Accurately identify visual duplicates with minimal false positives
Process 10,000+ images efficiently within reasonable time constraints
Provide clear, actionable results with space savings calculations
Maintain data safety with confirmation steps and backup recommendations
Handle edge cases gracefully without crashes or data loss

This specification provides a foundation for building a robust duplicate image finder that balances accuracy, performance, and user safety.
